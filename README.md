# Business Problem:

Our airline, known for delivering high-quality air transportation with a diverse fleet, is grappling with profitability challenges. Rising costs from stricter environmental regulations, increased flight taxes, higher interest rates, escalating fuel prices, and a tight labor market are putting significant pressure on our margins. To address these issues, I am analyzing our database to uncover opportunities for improving occupancy rates and enhancing the average profit per seat.

# Key Obstacles:

Stricter Environmental Regulations: Increasing pressure to lower carbon emissions has led to more stringent environmental laws. These regulations not only elevate operating costs but also limit expansion opportunities.

Higher Flight Taxes: Governments are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft to address environmental issues and generate revenue, which raises the cost of flying and reduces demand.

Tight Labor Market: A shortage of skilled workers in the aviation sector has resulted in higher labor costs and increased turnover rates.

Let's dive into the analysis to tackle these challenges!
